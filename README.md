# 32-Bit-ALU-using-Verilog-HDL
Introduction: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a crucial component in digital systems, responsible for executing arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU takes in two 32-bit binary numbers as inputs and performs operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise logical operations (AND, OR, XOR), and comparison operations. The output of the ALU is the result of the specified operation.
Design Methodology:

The ALU performs the different operations including adders, subtractors, bitwise logical operators, and comparators. The main ALU module takes control signals as inputs to determine the operation to be performed and selects the appropriate sub-module accordingly.

Implementation: 
The design is implemented in Verilog HDL using behavioral modeling. ports. The main ALU module instantiates the required sub-modules and connects them based on the control signals.
